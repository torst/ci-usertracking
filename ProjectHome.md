User Tracking for CodeIgniter is a library/add-on package for the popular open-source PHP framework, CodeIgniter.

Just like Google Analytics or Piwik, this plugin allows you to quickly and easily track usersâ€™ activity on your website.  Unlike other solutions, this library will output data directly to your database and allow you to define criteria for when to track and when to track and when not to track pageviews.

It is implemented as a single 14kb library, and it handles user tracking completely within CodeIgniter with no Javascript required.
